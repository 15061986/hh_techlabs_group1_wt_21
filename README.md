### The Group Project Nivea Star Trekker
<br>
This project was carried out as part of the TechLabs “Digital Shaper Program” in Hamburg (winter term 2021/22) in cooperation with Beiersdorf.
The group project "Nivea Star Trekker" worked on a data set originating from the Nivea website, that was provided by our mentor Christian. It contains reviews and ratings of Beiersdorf products given by customers since 2012. The goal was to find a classification model for the "Review Score Classification" problem, that is to predict the review score on the basis of the review text. This approach should help to prevent bad ratings by mistake, with the review text being positive.

<h4> Due to data protection reasons, the data set was not uploaded, but can be requested from our mentor Christian.</h4>
